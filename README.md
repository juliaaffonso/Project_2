# Project 2 - Lede Program 2025

## What's This?

This is a data analysis of vehicle accidents that occurred on Brazilian highways between 2021 and 2025. The dataset includes information such as the date of the accident, its cause, a description of the event, the number of victims, location coordinates (latitude and longitude), and more.

Accidents were classified using Artificial Intelligence (ChatGPT). Two new columns were created:

A broad category column: human error, non-human error, or other (for unclear cases like brake failure).

A detailed category column with labels such as human cause – alcohol or human cause – drugs.

## Findings

The vast majority of highway accidents in Brazil between 2021 and May 2025 were caused by human error. This conclusion is based on the classification of nearly 300,000 crash records.

In the state of Santa Catarina, the average distance between alcohol- and drug-related accidents and nightlife venues is 3.5 kilometers (2.1 miles).
